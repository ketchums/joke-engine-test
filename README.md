# joke-engine

Frontend interface and private API for generating X amount of jokes with an external API.

## Testing

Before testing this, please change the constant variable `API_ENDPOINT` to ensure the frontend makes a HTTP request to the correct endpoint. This variable is located in the frontend folder in /assets/js/app.js on line 1.

Once this is done, everything should work as expected.
